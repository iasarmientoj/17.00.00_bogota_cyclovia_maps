# bogota_cyclovia_maps
In this project I wanted to represent a simplified and interactive view of the different routes of the Bogot√° cyclovia and their reference locations. The objective was to encourage people to use the cyclovia and offer them a resource to locate themselves and learn more interesting details about the route.
